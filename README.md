# URL_to_QR
QR Code is a machine-readable matrix barcode that uniquely represents information. QR code is used for multiple purposes like making payments, sharing WiFi, etc. This program converts any Uniform Resource Locator (URL) entered by the user into the Quick Response code (QR). 

# Code understanding
We have installed two modules here: qrcode and image.
qrcode module is a QR code generator. The module automates most of the building process for creating QR codes. This module attempts to follow the QR code standard as closely as possible. User will input the text/url to convert to QR code. A code will be generated using the function defined of the parameters given in the code. It will be then saved in the given location using the qrcode module in the .png format.
